# h-core (codename: SuperTrouper)

## uKernel and components source code.

You need:

- The GCC toolchain (MinGW) for the kernel and bootloader.
- HintKit for Compilation check.
- Netwide Assembler to output COFF object code.

Start by cloning the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:Mahrouss-Logic/h-core.git
```

And execute:

```
make all
```

You'd also need The SDK and MinGW, to build and link the components. For Tools look at `Public/Tools`
